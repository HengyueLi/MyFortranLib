## This is a personal Fortran lib, most of which will be used to build a Variational Cluster Approach (VCA) package. 

Since this project is still under developing,  full description is not yet written. Later this project may be published by using the other kind of license. 

## Recently it contains:
## 1. ED cluster solver for fermion 1/2 system. Any kind of interacting can be easily appended to the Hamiltonian. Real and Complex Hamiltonian can be distinguished. Symmetry (U1, SU2) can be used.


  1-1. Lanczos solver(for zero temperature)
Any physical quantities, single particle Green's function, and two-particle Green's function can be calculated.

  1-2. Household Method(finite temperature)
Any physical quantities and single particle Green's function can be calculated. 

## 2. Optimization 
  Offer some methods to optimize multiple dimensional functions. (Quasi-Newton, DownHill...)

## 3. Some operation on matrix. This part is majorly based on Lapack.

## 4. Some numerical Integration method(Gauss-Legendre Quadrature ).

## 5. Some operation on lattice system. !
